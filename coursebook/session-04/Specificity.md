## Specificity in CSS

as you know in css before apply any properties you have to select the element, to select elements you have many methods like select by **id**, **class**, **tagName**, **attributes** or we can style it directly by inline style, but if you have select the element from two palces and you have changed color of the element in both palces which one will applie.
like :

> **index.html**
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/0G0bfyj.png" alt="final result" width="500" />

> **index.css**
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/kUjtBA6.png" alt="final result" width="500" />

> **Final Result**
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/EdeP2jN.png" alt="final result" width="500" />

so why css applied the second one?, because select by id is stronger than select by class.
