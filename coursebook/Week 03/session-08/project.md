### *Important notes:*:boom::boom:
 it will help you to improve your quality of the code.
 ### 1.Analysis project:
 - Firstly discuss with the team  the structure of the project, then start to split it to many tasks. 
- Define the branding of the project like ( main colors, font family, pictures, font size) and document it by opening an issue.

- Use beautify extension for CSS files to fix indentation
- Make sure your linter is working
