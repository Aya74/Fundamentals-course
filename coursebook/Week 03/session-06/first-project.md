# Session 06 : First Project

We want you to work together with your team over the next few days to build a small site from scratch.

There are five project ideas and, every team who consist of three members will work on one idea.

* Resturant website.
* Real state website.

## Project tips 📝

Feel free to choose the project design, structure and content as well as agree with your team after doing many searches and inspirations. 
### These points should be applied : 
* Apply semantic HTML in a good way.
* The project should be responsive.
* The project must has 2-page at least.

## Build Process 💻

Your team needs to set up a new repository on Github and work together over the next few days to commit changes to this repository.

### Your repo should contain a README file with these three points : 
* WHO (team members).
* WHY (describing the purpose).
* WHAT (describing your site).
* HOW (describing the journey to completion).

When working together, groups should split into pairs to complete project tasks, making sure they are constantly communicating with each other. Please note that although in the git workshop you were instructed to work in pairs and merge each other's pull requests, as you're working in teams now, you will be merging the other pair's pull requests!

## Publishing ☑️ 

* On completion, your site should be published via github pages. You may decide to publish early (perhaps to check how it looks on mobile, tablet, etc).

* Your README should also include a link to the live site (you can also add a direct link next to the description at the top of your repo, so that others can clearly find your live site).

## Guidelines 📝

* Try drawing out rough sketches of your site first and agree on a design to work towards throughout the project.

* Adding issues to your github repo is highly recommended, so you can easily keep track of what needs to be done/resolved, and who should be responsible.

* You may will encounter merge conflicts when working together on the same files. Don't panic, discuss the conflicts with your team before reaching a resolution.

* If you decide to use and stick to a particular naming convention for your CSS classes before starting the project then that's awesome! At the very least, aim to organise your CSS rules so they grouped together well and use clear descriptive class names.  

* You should consider installing the Prettier plugin (code formatter) in your editors to ensure your team code is consistent. An easy step by step guide can be found here: https://prettier.io/.

## Deadline 🕑

You will present your project to the rest of the course at the next week, so aim to discuss with your team how you will present your work.

### Good luck 😃
