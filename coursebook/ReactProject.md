## The Project

The task is to build a project, which uses the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.eu) to get country data and display it.

You should use the React framework/library on the front-end. You have complete control over which packages you use to do things like make HTTP requests or style your project.

Your users should be able to:

- See all countries from the API on the homepage
- Search for a country using an `input` field
- Filter countries by region
- Click on a country to see more detailed information 
- Click through to the border countries on the detail page
- Toggle the color scheme between light and dark mode *(optional)*
- You must also add some sort of **unit testing** and any other testing you desire to the project

## Building your project

When you build your project you will need to:

- Upload it to github
- Include a readme which:
  - Describes what the project does
  - Describes how to set up a local version of the project
  - Describes how to run the tests 
  - The more informative and detailed your readme, the better
- Deploy the code to a live site - ideally you should deploy using [firebase](https://firebase.google.com/docs/hosting/quickstart)
- Share both the github and the live site with us using [this form](https://airtable.com/tblZzuCyV4cqIQMjP/viwN6mwGbYZ60EtD2?blocks=hide).

### Support

We strongly encourage this to be a PEER learning experience. We encourage you to share thoughts and discussion on the Discord Server and we will arrange regular check ins to chat as a group.

**Have fun building!** ðŸš€

Please note, this project is a slightly modified of [this project](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/rest-countries-api-with-color-theme-switcher-5cacc469fec04111f7b848ca) found on Frontend Mentor. You may take a look at the designs there and do something similar, but you should also think about your own designs if you like. Try to make it look modern and user friendly.
