## Web Development Tools

These are some of the basic tools you will use regularly. You may not know what they are now, but you most certainly will going forward.

- Browser: ([Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
- Text Editor: ([VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)) & [CodePen](https://codepen.io/)
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) Account

There are more tools that you are going to need the more advanced of a web developer you become but these are enough to get you going with this course.
