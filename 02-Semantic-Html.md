## Semantics

#### Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.

#### Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

#### A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer.

### What’s a Semantic Element ?

Semantic Elements refer to HTML elements that have a specific meaning. For example `<h1>` is a semantic element. It tells google bots that the content within the tag is the most significant header contained in the HTML document. `<div>` on the other hand, is a non-semantic element as it only indicates a division in the HTML document and provide no information on what goes before, after or within the tag.

#### The Fight Against Divits!!!

##### Instead of div’s everywhere with ID’s and classes, use semantic HTML5 tags. but why ??

- accessibility - help assistive technologies read and interpret your webpage.
- searchability - help computers make sense of your content.
- interoperability - help other programmers understand the structure of your webpage.
