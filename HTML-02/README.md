### What HTML5 do ?

- It supports audio and video controls with the use of `<audio>` and `<video>` tags.
- Vector graphics is additionally an integral a part of HTML5 like SVG and `<canvas>`. \
   example on `<canvas>`:
    <iframe height="265" style="width: 100%;" scrolling="no" title="Lines and Dots" src="https://codepen.io/Tibixx/embed/eXOyXg?height=265&theme-id=default&default-tab=js,result" frameborder="no" allowtransparency="true" allowfullscreen="true">

## Semantics

#### Semantics is the study of the meanings of words and phrases in a language.

#### Semantic elements = elements with a meaning.

#### A semantic element clearly describes its meaning to both the browser and developer.

### What’s a Semantic Element ?

Semantic Elements refer to HTML elements that have a specific meaning. For example `<h1>` is a semantic element. It tells google bots that the content within the tag is the most significant header contained in the HTML document. `<div>` on the other hand, is a non-semantic element as it only indicates a division in the HTML document and provide no information on what goes before, after or within the tag.

#### The Fight Against Divits!!!

##### Instead of div’s everywhere with ID’s and classes, use semantic HTML5 tags. but why ??

- accessibility - help assistive technologies read and interpret your webpage.
- searchability - help computers make sense of your content.
- interoperability - help other programmers understand the structure of your webpage.
